# Flip.id Technical Task for Test Engineer

Hi, my name is Aldryan Deschara Putra, but you can call me Dimas

Here is my repository to the Chapter 3 answers

Please pardon me using Cypress 9.7.0 as the latest Cypress is in version 11 already. I am not get used to version 10+ so I decided to install and use version 9.7.0 instead to shorten the time configuring and understanding the syntax.

Please do `npm install cypress` first after cloning this repo, just in case the Cypress version in your device is different from this repo.

Thank you in advance, looking forward to hearing from you.
